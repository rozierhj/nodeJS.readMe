# Create README

  ## Description 
    The purpose of this project was to create a javascript application in nodejs that would enable the user to auto-create readme files from prompts provided by the system.

  ## Installation
    Include the modules 'fs' and inquirer from NPM as well as any local modules that may exist.

  ## Usage

  #### [link to the application webpage (if applicable)]()
  #### [link to the git repository](https://github.com/rozierhj/nodeJS.readMe/tree/main)

    The user enters the node index.js command and then the system will ask them questions related to the typical fields in a README file. This includes things like the description, usage, license etc. Once the user answers all of the questions a README file will be generated.
